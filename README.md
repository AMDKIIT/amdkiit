AMDKIIT is a density functional theory program package based on plane-wave basis sets for performing ab initio molecular dynamics at higher rungs of density functionals. This program is getting developed at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur through a funding received from the National Supercomputing Mission and Center for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune. 

To compile the code you require the following
1. CMake version 3.4 or higher
2. gfortran / ifort compiler
3. yaml-cpp(https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) should be downloaded and copied inside the source directory
4. Lapack libraries 
5. FFTW3 libraries 
6. LIBXC libraries
See INSTALL for more details
